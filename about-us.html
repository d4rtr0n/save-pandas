	<h3>Save the pandas</h3>
	<p>
		The effects of nearly a century of commercial <em>panding</em> have had long-lasting effects. Luckily, a 1986 ban made commercial <em>panding</em> illegal worldwide. But there is still work to be done to save the <em>pandas</em>.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h2>We must stop the Panda slaughter</h2>
	<p>
		A few countries - namely Japan, Norway and Iceland - continue to ignore a 1986 moratorium on commercial </em>panding</em>. Every year, these three countries kill thousands of <em>pandas</em>, selling their meat on an illegal black market.

		<strong>We are the Panda Rangers, based in Amsterdam.</strong> 
		<br>
		Our mission is to save all the cute pandas from being slaughtered and eaten.

	<h3>The Panda Rangers mission</h3>
	<p>
		Our mission with the panda rangers is to make life awesome for the pandas. We want to make sure that they don't die out and they can play and be cute together forever. We want <em>peace, love, and unity</em> for all pandas and panda lovers throughout the world.

	<h3>Our inspiration</h3>
	<p>

	<p class=disclaimer>
		Disclaimer: The text in the sections "Save the Pandas" and "Be a Panda Ranger" was fully stolen from the <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/oceans/save-the-whales/">Save the Whales - Greenpeace page</a>. I changed "whales" to "pandas" and "whaling" to "panding". The "Panda Rangers Mission" text is bullshit, but I promise I wrote it myself.
